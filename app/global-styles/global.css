 * As of 10/18/25 Turbopack (Next.js) currently has a bug where remote CSS imports
 * lose their layer() and media query attributes. Local imports work correctly
 * because Turbopack bundles them inline with proper @layer and @media wrappers.
 * 
 * Bug reports:
 * - Lightning CSS: https://github.com/parcel-bundler/lightningcss/issues/1074
 * - No bug report for Next.js at the moment. Just didn't have the motivation at the time ðŸ˜…
